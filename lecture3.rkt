;1. After reading this paper, I've come to a realization that
;you cannot surely define if a number is the biggest one.
;I've learnt about the power of the exponential function.
;The most important thing being the relation between mathematical reasoning and one's mother tongue.

;2. In my high school, I used to question the very concept of infinity,
;and now after reading about the ambiguity of the biggest number,
;the concept of infinity feels even vaguer to me.
;I wish someone could explain me fully the concept of Infinity.
